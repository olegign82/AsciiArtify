Kubernetes is an open source orchestration platform for containers. It offers an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and managing containerized applications. 

Setting up a local Kubernetes environment as your development environment is the recommended option, no matter your situation, because this setup can create a safe and agile application-deployment process.
There are multiple platforms that you can try out to run Kubernetes locally, among those are minikube, kind and k3d. 

See doc/Concept.md page for comparison table and cluster deployment demo video.

**Consider using Podman to avoid licensing issue:**

Docker license is not required only for personal use (subscription is required for bigger companies) when Podman is an open-source project and is free to use. Podman also puts focus on security and simplicity.
